// The map of the world is a 2D array, where each value represents a square 
// If the value is 0, that square represents an empty, walkthroughable square, and if 
// the value is higher than 0, it represents a wall with  a certain color or texture.
// The map declared here is versprites_idx4y small, only 24 by 24 squares, and is defined directly 
// in the code. For a real game, like Wolfenstein 3D, you use a bigger map and load it 
// from a file instead. All the zero's in the grid are empty space, so basicly you see 
// a very big room, with a wall around it (the values 1), a small room inside it (the 
// values 2), a few pilars (the values 3), and a corridor with a room (the values 4).
