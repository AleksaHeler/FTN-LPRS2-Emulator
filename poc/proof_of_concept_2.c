   If the value is 0, that square represents an empty, walkthroughable square, and if 
   the value is higher than 0, it represents a wall with  a certain color or texture.
   The map declared here is very small, only 24 by 24 squares, and is defined directly 
   in the code. For a real game, like Wolfenstein 3D, you use a bigger map and load it 
   from a file instead. All the zero's in the grid are empty space, so basicly you see

   values 2), a few pilars (the values 3), and a corridor with a room (the values 4). */
